<h1>Tennis</h1>
<p>Tennis is a racquet sport that can be played individually against 
a single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players each 
(doubles). Each player uses a racquet that is strung with cord to 
strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net 
and into the opponent's court. The object of the game is to play the 
ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a good return. 
The opponent who is unable to return the ball will not gain a point, 
while the opposite opponent will.</p>
